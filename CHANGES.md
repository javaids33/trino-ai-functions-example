# Enhanced AI Translate Functionality

## Changes Made

### 1. Post-Query Validation and Reasoning

We've added post-query validation to provide more detailed reasoning about how the natural language query was translated to SQL. This helps users understand:

- How the SQL query addresses their natural language question
- What tables and columns are being used and why they're relevant
- Any filters, aggregations, or joins in the query and their purpose
- Whether the SQL query fully answers the original question
- Any limitations or assumptions made in the translation

### 2. Metadata Extraction and Display

We've enhanced the response with metadata information about:

- Tables used in the query
- Columns referenced in the query
- Query type (SELECT, AGGREGATION, JOIN, etc.)

This metadata helps users understand what data is being used to answer their questions and how it's being processed.

### 3. UI Improvements

We've updated the conversation viewer UI to display:

- The enhanced reasoning about the query
- The metadata used in the query
- A better organization of conversations by request

### 4. Conversation Management

We've improved the conversation management to:

- Start a new conversation for each query
- Track the original query in each conversation
- Display a list of past conversations with their original queries

## How to Test

You can test the enhanced functionality using the provided test scripts:

```bash
python test_ai_translate_api.py
```

This will send a test query to the AI translate API and display the response, including the enhanced reasoning and metadata.
